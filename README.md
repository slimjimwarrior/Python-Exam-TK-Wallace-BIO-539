# Python-Exam-TK-Wallace-BIO-539
Repository for all python code and unit tests for python exam for BIO 539 for TK Wallace

## Content of Repository
### this repository is divided into 2 folder

1. Python_script - has all the neccesary functions required to calculate linguistic complexity, including functions to calculate all observed substrings in a string and all possible subtrings in a string. the linguistic complexity script takes a text file as the argument, while the other 2 function only take a string. However, the linguistic complexity function also outputs all possible strings and all observed strings in addition the linguistic complexity proportion.

  the files in this folder are :
  
    linguistic_complexity_final - calculates linguistic complexity of a string in a text file.
    count_observed_script_final - counts all observed substring of size k in a string. Arguments are a string of any size and k, which defines the substrings size you are         hoping to find.
    count_possible_script_final - counts all possible substrings using the same arguments as count_observed_script_final file.
